Project Repository for MATH 261A for Paper 2

## Data
Data used in this project are obtained from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FronkonGames/steam-games-dataset) which consist
of 83.6k games from the Steam game catelogue. 

## Structure
The final report and code files are in the analysis folder. This consists of code for dataset setup, analysis, and report. 

## External Resources
The final report and code were written by An Truong, but the following resources were used for preliminary research:

* R Programming Language (libraries: tidyverse, usethis, cowplot, etc.)
* LLM-based chatbots (ex. Claude, Gemini). 
* Online forums (ex. Stack Overflow).
